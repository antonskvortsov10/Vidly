<p><h3>Here are examples of how this application works:</h3></p>

<p><strong>First of all, let's visit the home page:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr1.png"></p>

<p><strong>Then let's move to the log in page:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr2.png"></p>

<p><strong>Now we need to fill in the form. Let's log in as an admin:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr3.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr4.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr5.png"></p>

<p><strong>Now you can move to customers:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr6.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr7.png"></p>

<p><strong>This page supports pagination, sorting and searching:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr8.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr10.png"></p>

<p><strong>You also can add a new customer as an admin:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr11.png"></p>

<p><strong>You just need to fill in the form and then click the save button:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr12.png"></p>

<p><strong>However if you choice not free membership type you need to input your date of birth and be at least 18 years old:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr13.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr14.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr15.png"></p>

<p><strong>Now as you can see, the new customer was added:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr16.png"></p>

<p><strong>You can also watch the details of each customer, edit or delete it as an admin.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now we can visit the movies page:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr17.png"></p>

<p><strong>Here you can add a new movie:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr18.png"></p>

<p><strong>Watch details or edit it:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr19.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr20.png"></p>

<p><strong>Here you can also delete a movie as an admin:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr21.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr22.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr23.png"></p>

<p><strong>You can also fill in a new rental form:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr24.png"></p>

<p><strong>Now let's log out.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You can log in as a guest (you just need to fill in the log in form) or using your existing Facebook account:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr25.png"></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr26.png"></p>

<p><strong>However now you can't add, edit or delete a movie as you can see:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr27.png"></p>

<p><strong>But don't worry: pagination, sorting and searching are available:</strong></p>

<p><img src="Screenshots/Scr28.png"></p>

<p><strong>Now let's log out.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I want to notice that if you are logged out you can't open customers, movies or new rental tabs: you need to log in first.</strong></p>
